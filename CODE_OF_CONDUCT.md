# Code of Conduct

## Purpose
A welcoming, safe, and productive community for everyone.

## Scope
This Code applies to all project spaces (repo, issues, PRs, discussions, chats) and to anyone participating.

## Our Standards
**Do:**
- Be respectful and constructive.
- Welcome questions and assume good intent.
- Provide actionable, kind feedback.
- Use inclusive language.

**Do not:**
- Harass, insult, or demean.
- Discriminate based on personal characteristics.
- Disrupt discussions or derail threads.
- Share others’ private information without consent.

## Reporting
If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior:
- Email a maintainer listed in `MAINTAINERS.md`, or
- Open a private report via the “Report abuse” link on GitHub, or
- If needed, contact another trusted community member.

Provide: what happened, where, when, links or screenshots, and any prior context.

## Enforcement
- Maintainers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warnings, issue/PR locks, temporary bans, or removal from the community.
- Severe or repeated violations may result in permanent ban.
- Actions will be documented in a private moderation log.

## Appeals
