# Security Policy

ColonyCore is a lightweight open-source project. Please report security issues privately so we can fix them quickly for everyone.

## Supported Versions
We aim to patch the latest `main` and the most recent tagged release. Older releases may be closed as out of scope if they require invasive changes.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
- **Private report (preferred):** Email a maintainer listed in `MAINTAINERS` with subject `SECURITY: <short title>`.
- **GitHub Security Advisory (alternative):** Use “Report a vulnerability” in the repo’s Security tab.
- Please include: affected version/commit, impact, reproduction steps or PoC, environment, and any known workarounds.

## Our Process
1. We acknowledge within a few days and create a private tracking thread.
2. We triage severity, verify the issue, and plan a fix or mitigation.
3. We prepare a patch and tests. We may ask you to validate a candidate fix.
4. We release a patched version and publish a brief advisory. We credit reporters on request.

## Disclosure Policy
- We follow coordinated disclosure. Please do not publish details until a fix is released or 90 days have passed, whichever comes first.
- If exploitation is observed in the wild, we may accelerate release and disclosure.

## Scope
- In scope: this repository’s code and configurations.
- Out of scope: third-party dependencies (report upstream), user misconfiguration, or social engineering.

## Safe Harbor
Good-faith research, reported privately and within the law, will not be pursued legally. Testing must avoid harming others’ systems or data.

## Keys
If needed, share a public key in your first email. We can reply with a temporary key for encrypted follow-up.

## Non-Security Issues
Use the regular issue templates for bugs and features. Keep security reports private per above.

## Thank You
We appreciate responsible disclosure and will acknowledge contributors in advisories if you wish.
